## What is a branch

## What is a reference

-git dif: show the diff between working dir and committed code, or between staging area and committed code or between 2 different commits
-git merge: used for solving merge conflicts

## git revision: not a command
## commit messages

Default editor is vim

-'i' to inter insert mode
-Type commit message
-'Esc' ->

Or use 'git commit -m ""'

a fast forward merge happens when the target branch was merged from the current branch and there are no changes in the current branch since then

adding info about merge to check if merge works correctly..again

adding info and going to delete merge-demo branch
